# coref

Coref is a tool for doing coreference resolution for Swedish texts. It's currently under development.

## Usage

In order to try the tool, run `python3 main.py <path/to/your/config/file>`. For example `python3 main.py config/config.json` to use the example config file. The configuration file controls which algorithm is used and the parameters for it, as well as which input file is used. If the input is raw text, it should be saved with the .txt extension to be processed correctly.
